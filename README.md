# Colectomy survival models: <br> From Cox regression to ordinal classification
This repository was created with the aim of sharing the code used for the experimentation of my Master's Final Project. <br><br>

The diagram below shows the process of the two methodologies developed in this project.
  * Cox Regression Model, the experimentation of which is shown in file [ColectomyCoxRegressionModel.py](ColectomyCoxRegressionModel.py)
  * Proposed Hierarchical Model, the experimentation of which is shown in file [ColectomyHierarchicalModel.py](ColectomyHierarchicalModel.py)
